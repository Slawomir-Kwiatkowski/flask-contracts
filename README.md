The application allows you to manage delivery times to central warehouses and logistics centers. Thanks to the application: downtime is minimized and warehouse operation is optimized, which will reduce costs.

Customers and contractors of supplies will be able to log in to the application (verification of the account by e-mail (HTML styles) to the address provided).

Only customers of deliveries will be able to issue orders, while contractors will be able to reserve available delivery appointments and generate a pdf document with a barcode (https://www.slawomirkwiatkowski.pl/index.php/en/2021/07/16/reportlab-generating-and-downloading-pdf-in-flask/)

You can try the app here: https://flask-contracts.herokuapp.com
(In order to be able to create, view and accept contracts you must create an account - respectively the customer or the contractor)
